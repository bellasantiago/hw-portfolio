# Full-Stack Bootcamp - Week 2 Homework

## Task Given
As a new developer, a portfolio is, in many cases, the first contact the world has to the work of the developer.

On this task, we were givin the task of creating a three page website to hold a basic bio introductory page, a portfolio page and a contact form.

With the task of coding three separate responsive html pages using the CSS framework Bootstrap, the deliverable would be a responsive, deployed, funtional webpage.

## How the task was tackled
Starting with the design concept of colorful and modern, the background image and the font-style were chosen.
To ensure the three pages were cohesive through out, the choice of building first the core structure that would be carried over to the thre pages were made.
Once the main structure was satisfied as per the concept proposed, the code was copied to the other two pages.

With the main working structure in place, it was a matter of adding the unique contents of each page and testing all of the functionalities.

## Task Given
As a marketing agency, the task is to improve our own website to ensure accessibility standards are met.

It is expected that the below acceptance criterias have been met once the task is completed:
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## How the task was tackled
Since not all of the concepts in the acceptability criterias were addressed in the course at this point, the decision to undertake each acceptance criteria was done at a time through out the entire code.
Taking this approach has allowed the developer to review the entire code several times while researching and understanding different aspects of the code.
